# Write a function sum_numbers_from_user that:
# Asks the user to input a list of numbers separated by spaces (e.g., "1 2 3").

# Splits the input into a list and sums the numbers using a loop.

# Returns the sum. (Assume valid number inputs for now.)

# Example:
# User types "1 2 3" → 6

# User types "10 20" → 30

# User types "5" → 5

# Hint: Use input().split() to turn "1 2 3" into ["1", "2", "3"], then convert strings to ints.
