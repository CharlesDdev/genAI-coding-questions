# Write a function longest_starts_with that takes two strings
# and returns the longer one, but only if it starts with the other string.
# If neither starts with the other, or they’re the same length, return the first string.
# Use loops (no startswith()).

# Example:
# longest_starts_with("cat", "catnip") → "catnip" (catnip starts with cat, longer)

# longest_starts_with("dog", "cat") → "dog" (no match)

# longest_starts_with("hi", "high") → "high" (high starts with hi, longer)
