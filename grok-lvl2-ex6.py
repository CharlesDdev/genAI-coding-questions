# Write a function middle_char that takes a string
# and returns the middle character.
# If the string has an even length, return the first of the two middle characters.
# Use a loop to count the length (no len()), then find the middle.

# Example:
# middle_char("hello") → "l" (5 chars, middle is 3rd)

# middle_char("python") → "t" (6 chars, middle is 3rd/4th, take 3rd)

# middle_char("cat") → "a" (3 chars, middle is 2nd)
